<h1>Projects I have done</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Sky 5O | Team Project |March – May 2023
        <ul>
            <li>Developed license plate recognition and tracking software using a DJI Tello Drone using the Python language. Implemented a keyboard-based flight control system and a GUI that enables the user to initiate takeoff/landing, view flight instructions, access the camera, take a picture, and read the license plate. It then stores the license plate information that was extracted and stored into a text file. The user can also choose which images they want to extract text from.</li>

    <li>Axela | Team Project | March – May 2023
        <ul>
            <li>Designed and developed a robot that is targeted to children ages 6+ years old. We used Arduino and C++, integrating various sensors, an LCD panel, and buttons into the circuitry. It displays the time, date, weather, and an affirmation when buttons are pressed. It aims to get children interested in STEM at a younger age and serves as a companion for the children to have.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Smart Factory | Team Project | November – December 2022
        <ul>
            <li>Designed and developed a miniature factory using Arduino and C++, integrating a range of sensors, transistors, relays, diodes, and switches into the circuitry. Implemented functionalities to regulate water pump, LED, and fan based on received inputs, and utilized an LCD to display real-time data to the user. Additionally, included wireless control and passcode protection for added security.</li>
